# CopyLinks PlusPlus

Copylinks++ extracts all links from all opened tabs, sorts them, removes duplicates, and copies them to clipboard.

Copylinks++ allow you to choose where to copy from:
- current tab
- all tabs in current window
- all tabs in all windows

Copylinks++ allow you to filter what to copy:
- all links
- magnet links
- links to listed domains (ie: links to cyberlocker files)
- links filtered by regular expressions

It's possible to add domain to list by contextual menu

Options page let you:
- choose quick action for toolbar button (or by keyboard shortcut[alt+z])
- decide actions to show in contextual menu
- set your own list of domains

List of destination domains when saving is automatically sorted and duplicates are removed.
You can add domain to list with contextual menu item (current domain or link domain)

It is a companion for download manager like jdownloader.
